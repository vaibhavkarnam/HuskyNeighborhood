This project supports some of the backend features of the HuskyNeighborHood Application. 

The Husky Neighborhood app solves all the major problems pointed out in other existing event based
systems that we discussed above. The idea was to create a pool of all on-campus events at NEU and
restrict access to NEU affiliated people and organizations only so that we have a common yet
closed and relevant platform which serves the specific event searching and posting needs for
Northeastern University. In our app we have listings from only registered NU clubs and organizations. This makes sure that
events are posted by trustable organizations verified by an administration. Since the events
posted are local events at Northeastern it will help students and staff have a better user experience
and thus overcomes the shortcomings of a broad and cluttered search experience (as described in
above sections) provided by websites like Meetup and Facebook Events.
Students and faculty also get to explore events of clubs that they are not registered with (traditionally
via mailing lists) or not a part of, since our app lets one view any event posted without any restriction.
This is a great way to explore without commitments as opposed to the norm of clubs asking for your
email ids to add you to their mailing lists. One can avoid being spammed by emails and at the same
time explore a certain clubs events with no strings attached.
To provide better filtering and search results, we developed a tag based search system for
categorizing events and matching user’s interests. A tag is a way to categorize an event.
Organizations can attach up to five tags to an event while posting. Tags allow for better search ability
and help in displaying relevant results to users. On the search page the user has an option to search
by particular tag or a combination of tags.

Tasks:
Scenario 1 - Search for an event and bookmark it
You have heard from your friends about an event called ‘Ice Cream Social’ to be held at
Northeastern University. You want to look for it in the app and bookmark it. Then you want to
make sure this event got saved into your ‘Profile’ page for later reference. How would you do
this?
Scenario 2 – Register for an event and comment on it
You want to now register for the ‘Ice Cream Social’ event. You also want to comment “Please
bring Ben & Jerry’s” on the event. How would you do this? Also, how would you verify that this
event got saved to your profile for future reference?
Scenario 3 – Post an event as an organization
Now, imagine you are a member of the NU-ROBOS organisation at our campus. Your
organisation is conducting a event on campus next week and you are in charge of registrations
and publicity. You want to post the event in our app. How would you do this? Also, how would
you make sure the event was successfully posted?

which have been reimplemeted to support the persistance of the application data.
